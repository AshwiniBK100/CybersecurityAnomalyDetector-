# Cybersecurity Anomaly Detector

## Overview
The Cybersecurity Anomaly Detector is an AI-based tool that detects unusual patterns and potential cybersecurity threats in network traffic. It uses machine learning models to identify anomalies and logs them for review.

## Features
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detects network traffic anomalies using Isolation Forest and MLP (neural network) models.
- **Data Generation**: Creates synthetic network traffic for testing.
- **GUI**: Simple graphical interface for easy detection.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Tkinter (for GUI)

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python: Version 3.6 or higher. You can download it from the official Python website.
pip: Python package manager. It usually comes pre-installed with Python.
Git (optional): For cloning the repository, download it from the official Git website.
Step 1: Clone the Repository
You can clone the project repository from GitHub (if available) using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CybersecurityAnomalyDetector.git
Replace yourusername with your actual GitHub username or the appropriate repository URL.

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Creating a virtual environment helps to manage dependencies for your project. You can create one using venv:

bash
Copy code
cd CybersecurityAnomalyDetector
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Step 3: Install Required Packages
Install the necessary Python packages by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tk
This command installs:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms.
tk: For creating the GUI.
Step 4: Run the Application
After installing the required packages, you can run the application using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Replace main.py with the actual name of your Python file containing the CybersecurityAnomalyDetector class and GUI setup.
and Run the code q window will pop up
